# Contacts_Manager_
It's a little practical work I had to do during my first year at JUNIA ISEN to put into practice everything I'd learned in the C language.

The program is made like a telephone directory.
So you can :
Register a contact with first name, last name and number.
You can also consult your directory
Delete a contact.

Contacts are sorted and classified
# warning
This code only works on windows ;)
