# Contacts_Manager_
It's a little practical work I had to do during my first year at JUNIA ISEN to put into practice everything I'd learned in the C language.

The program is made like a telephone directory.
So you can :
Register a contact with first name, last name and number.
You can also consult your directory
Delete a contact.

Contacts are sorted and classified
# warning
This non-platform code only works on Windows ;)
If you want to make it work on other operating systems, you'll need to replace some of the Windows libraries I've used with cross-platform equivalents.
