# Contacts_Manager_
This is a small C-language program I had to create during my first year at JUNIA ISEN.

The program is made like a telephone directory.
So you can :
* Register a contact with first name, last name and number in a .txt file.
* You can also consult your directory
* Delete a contact.

Contacts are sorted and classified
# warning
This non-platform code only works on Windows ;)
If you want to make it work on other operating systems, you'll need to replace some of the Windows libraries I've used with cross-platform equivalents.
